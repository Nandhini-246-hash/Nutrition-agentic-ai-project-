## 🧠 How Agentic AI Works in This Project

This project uses an **Agentic AI** approach where:
- The **Agent** understands the user’s goal (e.g., lose weight, eat healthier)
- It **plans a sequence of tasks** (e.g., calculate BMI, suggest diet)
- Then **executes actions** (e.g., call API, retrieve data)
- Provides **dynamic and adaptive responses**
